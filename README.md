Thriving Expat has been updated to incorporate the latest features of **Next.js 15**. The new release focuses on performance, security, and modern development capabilities.

**Key Updates in Next.js 15:**

- **Async Request APIs**: Breaking change to cachingâ€”fetch requests and GET routes are no longer cached by default. Improves control over rendering and caching.
- **React 19 Support**: Enhanced hydration error handling and experimental React Compiler integration.
- **Turbopack Dev**: Faster builds and stable development performance improvements.
- **unstable_after API**: Experimental API to execute code after response streaming.
- **Caching Semantics**: Updated caching for fetch, GET handlers, and client navigation.
- **instrumentation.js API**: Server lifecycle observability for debugging and monitoring.
- **next.config.ts**: Full TypeScript support for configuration files.
- **Server Actions Security**: Secure endpoints and automatic cleanup of unused actions.

The updated code is currently in beta and available for testing.
